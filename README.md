# BBWP (Basic Bootstrap WordPress Theme)

BBWP is an ultra basic WP theme intended to be used as a base for theme development. It enables quick setup of a basic uncluttered WordPress theme, with includes for Bootstrap and scripts for compiling and autoprefixing Sass, and watching for changes.

BBWP is based on the [Bootstrap npm starter template](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter), BBWP uses Bootstrap v4.6.

Basic use as follows

```shell
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Compile Sass
npm run css-compile

# Watch Sass for changes (uses nodemon)
npm run watch
```
